>> "Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs."   
~ Vaclav Havel

I came across this quote over the weekend as I was <a href="#" target="_blank">reading</a> Getting Things Done by David Allen.

Venturing adds life to a vision. It stops a vision from being just that. It makes it reality.

To venture means to do something that brings you closer to that place you've seen in your vision. It isn't always the biggest of actions you take.

Venturing is giving a smile because you are looking forward to a world filled with love; fixing a neighbour's computer because you want to help the world through technology; not desiring those clothes because you want to be a minimalist or even arranging the contents of your drawer at work because you want to be more organized.

In everything you do today or tomorrow or the next, make sure you do something that is a step towards your vision. **Give because love is not enough; work because faith is not enough and venture because vision is not enough.**
