A few weeks ago I watched an interview Mark Zuckerberg gave at a conference and something stood out for me. He said he believes Facebook is not in a "zero-sum" system.

Whats a zero-sum system? Its a system where everything must always add up to zero. An increase in one side must result in or be a result of a decrease on the other side of the system. For example, in a company with a fixed number of employees, for someone to get a promotion, some other person needs to be demoted or worse still, fired. So what he was saying is that for Facebook to "succeed" no other company has to fail.

Life itself isn't a zero-sum system. You might say the example I gave above happens several times in life. Yes, in life people get fired and people get employed but when someone gets fired they sometimes end up finding better jobs that weren't results of some other person being fired.

I also think the people and businesses that are managed with this mentality of life not being a zero-sum system are the ones that end up as successful.

All I am trying to say is that no one has to fall for you to stand, no one has to fail for you to succeed. And you don't have to fall for someone to stand, or fail for someone to succeed. So live your life, do what you have to do and leave the rest to God. **#LifeIsBeautiful**
