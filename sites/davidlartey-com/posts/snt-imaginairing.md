Happy New Year.

This blogging year hasn't started the way it should have started for me, so forgive the absence of new posts here so far. 

For my first blog post, I want to share a project I worked on during the holidays and have been yearning to share with you.

My younger sister loves to write, she wants to get better at it too and the only way to do that is to do the work. So I built her a website to share her writings (inspired by this Zen Habits' <a href="http://zenhabits.net/gifts/" target="_blank">gift guide</a>).

We called the project <a href="http://imaginairing.com/about/" target="_blank">***Imaginairing***</a> referring to "the process of becoming extremely rich in imagination". Like billionairing - that isn't a word but you get the idea - but for one's imagination.

This is how the site works: a new short story is posted every other week. These stories can be read online, downloaded as an ebook or as an audiobook on <a href="http://imaginairing.com/" target="_blank">imaginairing.com</a>.

Here are the first three posts:

* <a href="http://imaginairing.com/001-yova-the-innocent-sacrifice/" target="_blank">Yova: The Innocent Sacrifice.<a/>  
* <a href="http://imaginairing.com/002-joycelines-choice/" target="_blank">Joycelyn's Choice</a>  
* <a href="http://imaginairing.com/003-the-shame/" target="_blank">The Shame</a>  


There is a <a href="http://eepurl.com/_y5lX" target="_blank">newsletter</a>, an <a href="http://imaginairing.com/feed/" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Imaginairing" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Imaginairing" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ImaginairingOfficial" target="_blank">Google+</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/Imaginairing" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> pages to update you when a new story is published. And also a contact page for your feedbacks.

I have enjoyed working on it and I hope you enjoy it enough that you share a word about us.
