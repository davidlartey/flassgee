>> When you think of a problem over and over again in your mind, that's called worry. When you think about God's word over and over again in your mind, that's called meditation. If you know how to worry, you already know how to meditate! You just need to switch your attention from your problems to Bible verses. The more you meditate on God's Word, the less you will have to worry about.
