Adaptation. It's what keeps cockroaches alive when mammoths have been long gone. It's the difference between healthy innovative companies and the rest. It's the reason we have things like fire, clothes, computers, phones and all the others.

I believe that at some point in every life, we all encounter situations that demands us to adapt. Whether we like it or not. Life happens and after happening, demands us to adapt to what has happened.
I'm currently going through such a situation. Over the next few weeks and months, I would have to loosen my hold on some of my systems, I would have to work MORE, play and rest less.

I also believe that true adaptation knows when to return back to old ways.  
Currently, for me, there is the challenge of adapting to this new work schedule I have, but I'm expecting a even greater challenge in returning to how I use to live and work. My ability to do that would play a huge role in me becoming who I want to be in the long term.

**And I think its the same for everyone and everything in life. To fulfil one's purpose, you have to learn to adapt to changes in any direction of your life. Forwards or backwards.**
