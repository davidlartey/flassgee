During a conversation with a friend about rest rooms, he made a comment along the lines of "I don't ever use public rest rooms because I don't know who used it last and how they left it."

But what if everyone who uses the public rest rooms leaves them better than when they came in? How pleasant and healthy would it be? How many more people will stop being afraid of using them?  
What if I leave every room I enter better than when I came in?  
What if I leave the life of every person I meet better than the when I met them?  
...  

**What if we left people, places and things better than the way they were when they came into our lives?**
