A few years ago I started admiring the art of writing down one’s thoughts. I then developed the habit of keeping a journal, some of those thoughts I shared on my old blogs.

Then, I moved places and I totally lost that habit.  What was formerly done somewhat daily, is now only done roughly monthly. And I've used this as an excuse not to keep a blog.  

But I'm starting over. I've decided to use this blog to get and keep my writing on track.

One reason for this is: I'm learning that doers are people who are able to get back on track when they go off track. Whether its about writing, sticking to diet or becoming a scientist.  

Another thing that helps people get back and stay on track is accountability. So, I’ll like you to help keep me on track. I wont be blogging everyday but if you feel the blog has not been updated for a good enough time without any prior information, you are free to [contact me](mailto:me@davidlartey.com "Send me a mail") and say so. I'll be grateful when you do.  

**You should also consider restarting something this week and sharing it with the world.**

On a different note, I titled this post after seeing [Begin Again](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1980929/ "Begin Again (2013) IMDb") sometime last week. Its a nice movie.
