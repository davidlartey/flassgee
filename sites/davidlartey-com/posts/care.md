The older I get, the more responsible I become and the more I realise I'm limited and have weaknesses too. My response so far has been to avoid these as much as I can and pray that God helps me care less about them.

However, reading [this](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/09/forgive-yourself.html "Seth's Blog: Forgive yourself"), has given me a different way of thinking about imperfections. One that calls for forgiveness - forgiving myself. One that calls for caring instead of just turning a blind eye.

Caring, because:  
**It shows you are not ignorant about your life.**  
**It shows you want better.**  
**It leads you to find [grace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12%3A7-10&version=MSG "2 Corinthians 12:7-10 (The Message)").**  
**It makes you appreciate the healing process better.**  
**...**  

I choose to care about my limitations and I also choose to forgive myself for having them.

**Forgive yourself for being imperfect but don’t forgive yourself for not caring about that imperfection!**
